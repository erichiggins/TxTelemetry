Use with caution.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI'm open-sourcing this script under the\r\n[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) in order to\r\npreserve it and share with others.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntro\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRunning this script on an Android phone will allow you to receive GPS\r\ncoordinates, as well as other sensor data, over SMS (text messages).\r\nSMS was preferred because it works on even weak and slow cellular\r\nsignals, which are common in remote areas and at high altitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe recipient cell number must be changed from ```000-000-0000``` to the\r\nnumber of a cell phone **on the ground**. Preferably, a cell phone with\r\nthe best possible reception.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture plans\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI don't have any current plans to maintain this script. I've already\r\nlaunched and recovered my balloon with it, and have no near-future plans\r\nfor another launch. That *may* change, but folks are encouraged to fork\r\nthis script and modify it for their own needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n[on{X} API Reference](https://www.onx.ms/#!apiPage)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
